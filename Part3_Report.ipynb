    "** Results:** On unseen data, the random forest model predicted which users will be active in their 6th month on the system with 75% accuracy. This is a meaningful improvement over simply guessing that zero users will be retained, which would give an accuracy of 62%. Moreover, 78% of the users the model predicts will not be retained are in fact lost and 85% of the users that are lost are captured by the model. This means that the model will provide useful information for the \"customer-retention\" team at Ultimate. It will tell the team which users they should target for user-retention marketing efforts. \n",

    "1. Focus marketing attention on users who travel a long average distance in their first 30 days, take the majority of their trips during the weekdays, take the majority of their trips during surge pricing, and/or are given low ratings by drivers.\n",
